            This is an experiment of creating a webpage with chatGPT and copilot. <br>

            My name is Daniel Trad. I am 59 years old and I live in Calgary, Canada. <br>
            I am a professor of Geophysics at the University of Calgary. <br>
            I am passionate about computer science, skiing, and sailing. This is my personal webpage where <br>
            I share my thoughts and experiences.

        <p> Now, that was my own description. Let's see what the AI can do. </p>

            <p>
                Hello, my name is Daniel Trad, and I call the vibrant city of Calgary, Canada, my home. <br>
                I am a seasoned professional with a deep passion for computer science, skiing, and sailing. <br>
                My journey in the tech world has been driven by a curiosity for innovation and a commitment <br>
                to applying cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have embraced the ever-evolving landscape of computer science, <br>
                continually seeking to expand my knowledge and expertise. Whether it's delving into the intricacies of algorithms, <br>
                exploring the potentials of machine learning, or developing efficient software solutions, <br>
                I find great fulfillment in pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me embracing the natural beauty of the Canadian Rockies. <br>
                As an avid skier, I relish the thrill of carving through fresh powder and the serenity of the snowy mountains. <br>
                Similarly, sailing offers me a unique sense of freedom and adventure, navigating the waters and enjoying the peacefulness 
                that comes with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This personal webpage is a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and ongoing projects. <br>
                It's a reflection of my diverse interests and a platform to connect with others who share similar passions. <br>
                Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my journey as exciting and inspiring as I do.
