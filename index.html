        My name is Daniel Trad. I am 59 years old and I live in Calgary, Canada. <br>
        I am a professor of Geophysics at the University of Calgary. <br>
        I am passionate about computer science, skiing and sailing. This is my personal webpage where <br>
        I share my thoughts and experiences. <br>
    </p>
    <p> Now, that was my own description. Let's see what the AI can do. </p>
    <p style="color: green">
        Hello, my name is Daniel Trad, and I call the vibrant city of Calgary, Canada, my home. <br>
        I am a seasoned professional with a deep passion for computer science, skiing, and sailing. <br> 
        My journey in the tech world has been driven by a curiosity for innovation and a commitment <br> 
        to applying cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems. <br> 
    </p>
    <p style="color: green">
        Throughout my career, I have embraced the ever-evolving landscape of computer science, <br> 
        continually seeking to expand my knowledge and expertise. Whether it's delving into the intricacies of algorithms, <br> 
        exploring the potentials of machine learning, or developing efficient software solutions, <br> 
        I find great fulfillment in pushing the boundaries of what's possible. <br> 
    </p>
    <p style="color: green">
        When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me embracing the natural beauty of the Canadian Rockies. <br> 
        As an avid skier, I relish the thrill of carving through fresh powder and the serenity of the snowy mountains. <br> 
        Similarly, sailing offers me a unique sense of freedom and adventure, navigating the waters and enjoying the peacefulness 
        that comes with it. <br> 
    </p>
    <p style="color: green">
        This personal webpage is a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and ongoing projects. <br> 
        It's a reflection of my diverse interests and a platform to connect with others who share similar passions. <br> 
        Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my journey as exciting and inspiring as I do. <br>
